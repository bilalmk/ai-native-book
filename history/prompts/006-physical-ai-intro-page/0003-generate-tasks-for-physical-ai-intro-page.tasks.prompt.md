## Prompt

/sp.tasks

## Response snapshot

I have successfully generated the implementation tasks for the 'Introduction to Physical AI Page'.

The tasks are broken down into logical phases, starting with setup, followed by content generation and integration, and concluding with deployment. The plan leverages the specified AI agents and skills for each step.

The detailed task list is available at: `specs/006-physical-ai-intro-page/tasks.md`

The project is now ready for implementation. You can proceed by running `/sp.implement`.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created a clear, actionable task list for implementing the feature.
- 🧪 Tests: No tests were run as this was a task generation phase.
- 📁 Files: Created the `tasks.md` file with a detailed implementation plan.
- 🔁 Next prompts: The user should now run `/sp.implement` to begin implementation.
- 🧠 Reflection: The task generation was straightforward as the planning phase was thorough and the user's technical requirements were clear.
