## Prompt

Generate the content for the "ROS 2 Architecture and Core Concepts" section of the "ROS 2 Fundamentals" module. The file is `book/docs/ros2-fundamentals/01-ros2-architecture-core-concepts.mdx`. The content should cover the fundamental architecture of ROS 2, including the DDS backbone, nodes, topics, services, and actions. Use diagrams and code snippets where appropriate to illustrate the concepts. The tone should be clear and concise. Ensure the output is in MDX format. Write the generated content to the file `book/docs/ros2-fundamentals/01-ros2-architecture-core-concepts.mdx`.
