## Prompt

## Response snapshot

I have generated the tasks required to create the "ROS 2 Fundamentals" documentation. The tasks are broken down into three phases: Setup, Content Generation, and Deployment. The detailed task list is available at `specs/008-ros2-fundamentals/tasks.md`.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: The task list for creating the "ROS 2 Fundamentals" documentation has been successfully generated.
- 🧪 Tests: No tests were run.
- 📁 Files: `specs/008-ros2-fundamentals/tasks.md` was created.
- 🔁 Next prompts: The next step is to execute the tasks, starting with setting up the Docusaurus structure.
- 🧠 Reflection: The task generation was straightforward based on the well-defined plan.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: null
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS
- Prompt variant (if applicable): null
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): null
