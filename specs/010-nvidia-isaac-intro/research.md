# Research: NVIDIA Isaac Platform Introduction

This document resolves the ambiguities identified in the planning phase.

## Decision: Sidebar Structure

The primary ambiguity was how to structure the sidebar links for the new "NVIDIA Isaac Platform" section.

**Decision**: The "NVIDIA Isaac Platform" section will be a sub-category directly under the "Robot Simulation with Gazebo" section in the sidebar.

**Rationale**: This approach was chosen because it logically groups the NVIDIA Isaac Platform, a simulation and robotics platform, with Gazebo, another simulation platform. This provides a clear and intuitive navigation structure for the user.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Creating a new top-level sidebar category for "NVIDIA Isaac Platform" and adding a separate link under "Robot Simulation with Gazebo". This was rejected because it creates duplicate entry points and could be confusing.
- Creating a new top-level sidebar category without any link under "Robot Simulation with Gazebo". This was rejected because it misses the opportunity to group related content.
