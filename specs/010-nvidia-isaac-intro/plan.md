# Implementation Plan: NVIDIA Isaac Platform Introduction

**Branch**: `010-nvidia-isaac-intro` | **Date**: 2025-11-30 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `specs/010-nvidia-isaac-intro/spec.md`

## Summary

This feature involves creating a new documentation section for the "NVIDIA Isaac Platform". It includes a main introduction page and four chapter pages. The content will be generated by the `robotics-course-writer` agent, integrated into the Docusaurus site by the `docusaurus-architect` agent, and deployed using the `docusaurus-deployment` skill.
Scaffolding the New Section

## Scaffolding the New Section

**Task**: Create the "NVIDIA Isaac Platform" category in the sidebar.
  -   **Tool**: `docusaurus-architect` agent.
  -   **Prompt**: "Read the sidebar configuration from `book/sidebars.ts`. Add a new category with the label 'Robot Simulation with Gazebo'. This category should have a link to an index page at `nvidia-isaac-platform/index` and an empty `items` array for now."
  -   **Fallback**: If the `docusaurus-architect` agent fails to write to the file, use the `Bash` tool with `echo` and redirection to append the necessary configuration to `book/sidebars.ts`.
    
## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: TypeScript (latest stable)
**Primary Dependencies**: Docusaurus, React
**Agents/Skills**: `robotics-course-writer`, `docusaurus-architect`, `docusaurus-deployment`
**Storage**: N/A (content is stored as Markdown files)
**Testing**: Jest
**Target Platform**: Web (GitHub Pages)
**Project Type**: Web application
**Performance Goals**: Standard web performance (pages load in < 2s).
**Constraints**: [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: The user wants the links for the new chapters under the "NVIDIA Isaac Platform" section, but also wants "the newly generated link" to be placed under the "Robot Simulation with Gazebo" section. It's unclear if the entire "NVIDIA Isaac Platform" section should be a child of the "Robot Simulation with Gazebo" section, or if there should be a separate link.]
**Scale/Scope**: 1 introduction page and 4 chapter pages.

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- **Educational Excellence**: The plan aligns by using specialized agents (`robotics-course-writer`) to generate high-quality educational content.
- **AI-Native Development**: The plan heavily relies on AI agents (`robotics-course-writer`, `docusaurus-architect`) for content creation and site integration, adhering to this principle.
- **Spec-Driven Approach**: This plan is derived from a detailed specification, following the SDD process.
- **Innovation & Technology**: The plan leverages Docusaurus and custom AI agents as per the constitution.
- **User-Centric Design**: The goal is to create a clear and navigable documentation section for users.
- **Maintainability & Scalability**: Docusaurus structure is inherently maintainable.

**Result**: PASS

```

### Source Code (repository root)

The project follows the standard Docusaurus project structure. New content will be added to the `book/docs/` directory.

```text
book/
├── docs/
│   ├── ...
│   └── nvidia-isaac-platform/
│       ├── index.mdx
│       ├── 01-isaac-sdk-and-sim.mdx
│       ├── 02-ai-perception-manipulation.mdx
│       ├── 03-reinforcement-learning.mdx
│       └── 04-sim-to-real-transfer.mdx
└── ...
```

**Structure Decision**: The existing Docusaurus structure will be used. A new directory `book/docs/nvidia-isaac-platform` will be created to house the new pages.

## Complexity Tracking

No violations to the constitution have been identified.
