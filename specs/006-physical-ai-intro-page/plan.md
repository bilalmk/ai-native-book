# Implementation Plan: Introduction to Physical AI Page

**Branch**: `006-physical-ai-intro-page` | **Date**: 2025-11-30 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `specs/006-physical-ai-intro-page/spec.md`

## Summary

This plan outlines the steps to create a new introduction page for the "Physical AI" module. The implementation will leverage specialized AI agents for content creation and site integration, and a dedicated skill for deployment, as per user requirements. The goal is to produce a comprehensive, well-structured, and easily accessible introductory content page.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Markdown/MDX with React components in a Docusaurus (TypeScript) environment.
**Primary Dependencies**: Docusaurus, React, `robotics-course-writer` agent, `docusaurus-architect` agent, `docusaurus-deployment` skill.
**Storage**: N/A (content is stored as files in the Git repository).
**Testing**: The primary validation will be the Docusaurus build process, which ensures all content renders correctly.
**Target Platform**: GitHub Pages.
**Project Type**: Web (documentation site).
**Performance Goals**: Page load time under 2 seconds.
**Constraints**: The implementation must use the specified agents and skill for their respective tasks.
**Scale/Scope**: The scope is limited to the creation and integration of a single introduction page.

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- **Educational Excellence**: PASSED. The plan is to create high-quality, pedagogical content using a specialized agent.
- **AI-Native Development**: PASSED. The plan explicitly incorporates the use of Claude Code, Spec-Kit Plus, and specialized AI agents.
- **Spec-Driven Approach**: PASSED. This plan is derived directly from a detailed specification.
- **Innovation & Technology**: PASSED. The plan leverages Docusaurus and AI-native tools as defined in the constitution.
- **User-Centric Design**: PASSED. The plan is focused on delivering a clear and accessible introduction page for learners.
- **Maintainability & Scalability**: PASSED. The use of agents for integration helps ensure the site remains maintainable.

    └── physical-ai/
        └── introduction.mdx   # The new content page to be created
```

**Structure Decision**: The project follows the existing Docusaurus structure. A new file, `introduction.mdx`, will be added to the `book/docs/physical-ai/` directory. This is consistent with the current project layout and requires no changes to the established architecture.
