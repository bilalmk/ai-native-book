# Implementation Plan: Introduction to Physical AI

**Branch**: `007-physical-ai-intro-page` | **Date**: 2025-11-30 | **Spec**: [specs/007-physical-ai-intro-page/spec.md](specs/007-physical-ai-intro-page/spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `specs/007-physical-ai-intro-page/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/sp.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

This plan outlines the creation of four new pages for the "Introduction to Physical AI" module. The content for each page will be generated by the `robotics-course-writer` agent. The `docusaurus-architect` agent will then integrate these pages into the Docusaurus site structure and navigation. Finally, the `docusaurus-deployment` skill will be used to deploy the updated site.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Markdown/MDX with TypeScript for Docusaurus components.
**Primary Dependencies**: Docusaurus, React, `robotics-course-writer` agent, `docusaurus-architect` agent, `docusaurus-deployment` skill.
**Storage**: N/A (content is stored as files in the Git repository).
**Testing**: Manual verification of generated content and site structure.
**Target Platform**: Web (via Docusaurus and GitHub Pages).
**Project Type**: Docusaurus website.
**Performance Goals**: Standard web page load times.
**Constraints**: The generated content and site structure must be compatible with the existing Docusaurus setup.
**Scale/Scope**: Four new content pages to be added to the existing "Physical AI" module.

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- **Educational Excellence**: The plan to use the `robotics-course-writer` agent ensures that the content is pedagogically sound and technically accurate.
- **AI-Native Development**: The plan explicitly uses AI agents (`robotics-course-writer`, `docusaurus-architect`) and skills (`docusaurus-deployment`), adhering to this principle.
- **Spec-Driven Approach**: The plan is derived directly from the feature specification, ensuring alignment with requirements.
- **Innovation & Technology**: The use of specialized agents for content creation and site architecture demonstrates a commitment to leveraging cutting-edge tools.
- **User-Centric Design**: The plan focuses on creating clear, accessible educational content for the target audience.
- **Maintainability & Scalability**: The use of agents to manage content and structure ensures a consistent and maintainable approach.

**Result**: PASS. The plan aligns with all core principles of the project constitution.

### Source Code (repository root)

The Docusaurus project structure is already established. This plan will add new files to the `docs/physical-ai` directory.

```text
docs/
└── physical-ai/
    ├── 01-foundations-of-physical-ai.mdx
    ├── 02-from-digital-ai-to-robots.mdx
    ├── 03-humanoid-robotics-landscape.mdx
    └── 04-sensor-systems.mdx
```

**Structure Decision**: The plan will add four new Markdown files to the existing `docs/physical-ai` directory. The `docusaurus-architect` agent will be responsible for updating the sidebar and navigation to include these new pages under the "Physical AI" section.

## Task Breakup and Implementation Phase

### Phase 0: Content Generation

1.  **Task**: Generate content for "Foundations of Physical AI and embodied intelligence".
    *   **Tool**: `robotics-course-writer` agent.
    *   **Output**: `docs/physical-ai/01-foundations-of-physical-ai.mdx`
2.  **Task**: Generate content for "From digital AI to robots that understand physical laws".
    *   **Tool**: `robotics-course-writer` agent.
    *   **Output**: `docs/physical-ai/02-from-digital-ai-to-robots.mdx`
3.  **Task**: Generate content for "Overview of humanoid robotics landscape".
    *   **Tool**: `robotics-course-writer` agent.
    *   **Output**: `docs/physical-ai/03-humanoid-robotics-landscape.mdx`
4.  **Task**: Generate content for "Sensor systems: LIDAR, cameras, IMUs, force/torque sensors".
    *   **Tool**: `robotics-course-writer` agent.
    *   **Output**: `docs/physical-ai/04-sensor-systems.mdx`

### Phase 1: Integration and Site Structure

1.  **Task**: Integrate the four new content pages into the Docusaurus site. This includes creating the files, adding frontmatter, and updating the sidebar navigation to place the new pages under the "Physical AI" section.
    *   **Tool**: `docusaurus-architect` agent.
    *   **Input**: The four generated `.mdx` files.
    *   **Output**: Updated Docusaurus configuration and file structure.

### Phase 2: Deployment

1.  **Task**: Deploy the updated Docusaurus site to GitHub Pages.
    *   **Tool**: `docusaurus-deployment` skill.
    *   **Input**: The updated Docusaurus site.
    *   **Output**: A successful deployment to GitHub Pages.
