## Welcome to ROS 2 Fundamentals

Welcome to the world of ROS 2, the open-source framework that has become the standard for robotics development. This module introduces you to the core concepts of the Robot Operating System (ROS) 2, a powerful and flexible set of libraries and tools for building complex robot applications.

We will explore the fundamental architecture of ROS 2, designed for scalability, real-time performance, and multi-platform support, from small embedded systems to large-scale distributed environments. Understanding these fundamentals is the first step toward creating sophisticated robotics systems.

### What You Will Learn

In this module, we will demystify the essential building blocks of ROS 2. By the end of this section, you will have a strong conceptual grasp of:

- **The ROS 2 Ecosystem**: Understand the overall structure of ROS 2 and how its components interact.
- **Nodes**: The primary computational units in ROS 2 that perform specific tasks.
- **Topics**: The communication buses that allow nodes to exchange data in a publisher-subscriber model.
- **Services**: A request-response communication pattern for synchronous interactions between nodes.
- **Actions**: A more complex communication pattern for long-running, asynchronous tasks that provide feedback.
- **Launch Files**: The standard way to start and configure multiple nodes in a ROS 2 system.

### Prerequisites

To get the most out of this module, a basic understanding of the following is recommended:

- **Basic Programming Concepts**: Familiarity with either Python or C++ will be helpful, as these are the primary languages used with ROS 2.
- **Command-Line Interface**: Comfort working in a terminal or command-line environment, preferably on a Linux-based operating system.
- **General Robotics Concepts**: A high-level understanding of what constitutes a robot system (e.g., sensors, actuators) will provide useful context.
