title: NVIDIA Isaac Platform
---

## Overview.

The NVIDIA Isaac™ platform is a powerful end-to-end robotics platform for the development, simulation, and deployment of AI-powered robots. It provides a comprehensive set of tools and frameworks that accelerate the entire robotics workflow, from training and testing in a virtual environment to deploying on physical hardware.

At its core, the Isaac platform is designed to address the complex challenges of building autonomous machines. It enables developers to leverage NVIDIA's expertise in simulation, computer vision, and AI to create robust and intelligent robotic applications. By providing a unified platform, it streamlines the development process and allows for seamless transitions between simulation and real-world deployment.

### Key Conceptual Pillars

-   **Isaac Sim**: A photorealistic, physically accurate virtual environment for simulating robots in a wide range of scenarios. It allows for the testing of perception, navigation, and manipulation algorithms without the need for physical hardware.
-   **Isaac AMR**: A collection of hardware-accelerated libraries and software for building and deploying Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMRs). It provides foundational capabilities for mapping, localization, and navigation.
-   **Isaac Manipulators**: A framework for developing robotic manipulation applications, including perception, path planning, and control for robotic arms.

This module will explore the conceptual foundations of the NVIDIA Isaac platform, focusing on how its components work together to provide a holistic solution for modern robotics development.
